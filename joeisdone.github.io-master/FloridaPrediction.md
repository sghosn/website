# Florida Prediction edition

The [Florida early voting](http://joeisdone.github.io/florida) page has gone viral, and spawned a bunch of people speculating on what it all means. Is 480K too insurmountable of a lead for Republicans to overcome? Should Democrats be worried about the in-person early voting (IPEV) Republican performance? *Who should be worried, anyway?* 

This post attempts to answer that question. Richard Baris would call this useless tea-leaf reading, but tea-leaf reading is the only thing we have at this point.

## Florida isn't like other states

The premise of "JoeIsDone" is that Democrats are not turning out the VBM numbers they need to win the election. That applies to a state like NC, but not FL so much. Why? 

Florida already has a strong history of VBM and early voting, so it's harder to infer how COVID-19 fears will impact Florida specifically. 

Here are the [raw vote numbers from 2016](https://dos.myflorida.com/media/697363/early-voting-and-vote-by-mail-report-2016-gen.pdf) broken by party and method:

| Voting Method | Democrats | Republicans | Unaffliated / NPA | Total (includes third parties) |
|-----------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| In-person early vote (IPEV) | 1,580,003 (43.27%) | 1,425,309 (38.35%)  |  779,627 (39.32%)         | 3,874,929 (41.13%)              |
| Vote by mail (VBM)          | 1,049,809 (28.75%) | 1,108,053 (29.81%)  |  504,895  (25.47%)  | 2,732,075  (29.00%)             |
| Election Day votes          | 1,021,740 (27.98%) | 1,183,162 (31.84%)  | 698,034 (35.21%)         | 2,813,035  (29.86%)            |
| Total votes                 | 3,651,552 | 3,716,524   | 1,982,556         | 9,420,039           |
| *IPEV + VBM combined*         | *2,629,812 (72.02%)* | *2,533,362 (68.16%)*   | *1,284,522 (64.79%)*         | *6,607,004 (70.14%)*               |

*Note: I pulled the [totals off this website](https://electionsmith.wordpress.com/2017/01/17/exclusive-first-cut-at-2016-turnout-rates-in-florida-by-party-and-raceethnicity/), so the numbers are not exact.*

Put simply, in 2016, **a full 70% of the electorate had already early voted.** Trump came into the election with a [96,450 point deficit](http://www.electionczar.com/floridaearlyvote.html), which was then overcame with Republicans compromising 42% of the Election Day electorate.

# Current state (21-Oct)

This is the current state as of writing (excluding today's Saratosa and Miami-Dade data): 

| Voting Method | Democrats | Republicans | Unaffliated / NPA | Total (includes third parties) |
|-----------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| In-person early vote (IPEV) | 378,540  | 465,313   |  161,975          | 1,017,620              |
| Vote by mail (VBM)          | 1,516,008    |  968,224   | 633,935 | 3,155,740    |
| *IPEV + VBM combined*         | *1,894,548* | *1,433,537*   | *795,910*         | *4,173,360*               |

Breaking out by their respective 2016 metrics, we see the following: 

| Voting Method | Democrats | Republicans | Unaffliated / NPA | Total (includes third parties) |
|-----------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| In-person early vote (IPEV) | 23.96% of 2016 Dem IPEV  | 32.65% of 2016 Rep IPEV   |  20.78% of 2016 NPA IPEV          | 26.26% of 2016 IPEV            |
| Vote by mail (VBM)          | 144.41% of 2016 Dem VBM  |  87.38% of 2016 Rep VBM   | 125.56% of 2016 NPA VBM  | 115.5% of 2016 VBM    |
| *IPEV + VBM combined*         | *72.04% of 2016 Dem EV* |  *56.69% of 2016 Rep EV*  | *61.96% of 2016 NPA EV*        | *63.17% of 2016 EV*             |

# What do the polls say? 

Currently, the best poll we have on how people will vote is probably the [University of North Florida](https://www.unf.edu/uploadedFiles/aa/coas/porl/FLFallOct2020.pdf) poll that was released yesterday.  
  
Within the crosstabs, we find the following vote preference by party registration: 

| Voting Method | Democrat | Republican | NPA |
|---------------|----------|------------|-----|
| IPEV          | 32%      | 24%        | 33% |
| Mail          | 55%      | 37%        | 37% |
| Election Day  | 12%      | 37%        | 29% |
| Don't know    | 2%       | 3%         | 1%  |

Some oddities should jump out. For example, if the poll is to be believed, we should see a *larger proportion of Republicans turn out for Election Day than in 2016.* That doesn't seem right, but Gallup says that [early voting has become a partisan issue](https://news.gallup.com/poll/321602/extreme-partisan-gaps-early-voting-emerge-year.aspx). 

# Reading the tea leaves...

Let's read the tea leaves in the turnout. What if we cast 2016's turnout to the poll numbers? We arrive at the following:

| Voting Method | Democrats | Republicans | Unaffliated / NPA |
|-----------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| IPEV          | 1,168,494 (32%) | 891,966 (24%)  |  654,243  (33%)         |
| VBM           | 2,008,353 (55%) | 1,375,114 (37%)  |   733,545  (37%)  |
| Election Day  |  438,186 (12%) |  1,375,114 (37%)  |  574,941 (29%)         |
| 2016 total votes   | 3,651,552 | 3,716,524   | 1,982,556         |
| *IPEV + VBM combined* | *3,176,850 (87%)* | *2,267,079 (61%)*   | *1,387,789 (70%)*         |

(We will ignore Don't Knows.) 

Obviously, this doesn't align with our data. Republicans are lagging way behind on VBM, independents are way overperforming on VBM, Republicans are overperforming with early voting. . 

But it's the best we have. 

But by that model: 

* Republicans are **63.23%** to their EV target (1,433,537 / 2,267,079). 
* Democrats are **59.64%** to their EV target (1,894,548 / 3,651,552).
* NPAs are **57.35%** to their EV target (795,910 / 1,387,789). 

Before you go out Tweeting that Republicans are actually kicking butt and taking names, there are many reasons to not to take this model as gospel. 

* It doesn't match up with the real world data. 
* We don't know how the 'don't knows' allocate. 
* It is doubtful that Republicans will have higher turnout on Election Day 2020 than they did in 2016.
* The Democrats appear to have requested more VBM than their target would imply (2,631,697).

And most importantly: 

**It's been only three days since IPEV started.**

The return rates and IPEV have been rather volatile. 

# The "magic numbers" 

There's been extensive discussion of the "magic numbers" - aka the gap between Democrat and Republican VBM and IPEV to secure a victory. 

From the raw model above, these would be 633,239 for VBM (which closely matches the one that's been tossed around) and 276,528 for IPEV for a combined magic number of 909,767 (!).  
  
But, again, there are many unknowns. Conservatively assigning all of the 2% "Unknown" to the Republican EV (-74,330) and 3% to the Democrat Election Day (-109,465) brings that number down to 725,972 (combined IPEV and VBM lead).

And finally, just because I don't trust that 37% of Republicans will turn out on Election Day, I'd further conservatively knock off a 6% (-222,990). 

That brings the "magic number" to 502,982. Higher turnout will push the number up and lower turnout will push the number down.

Overall, Florida isn't going to be a cakewalk. But should be doable for Trump with a few more days like today's. 

All this article really is, is just tea leaf entertainment reading in the end. 

# What's a good "advantage" for Trump? 

One of the more discussed things about the Florida early voting is the "Advantage." 

At first, I measured the advantage as the R-D gap compared to the Trump-Hillary gap. I noticed this greatly favored blue counties at the expense of deep red counties, so I sought a fairer comparison. 

So I based the advantage off the 2016 early voting R-D gap. But, again, since Democrats have declared a preference to early vote, this wasn't completely fair either. 

In 2016, 39.80% of early voters were Democrat, and 38.34% of early voters were Republican (39.8%-38.34%).

According to the above poll, and adding in the 3% unknowns plus 6% Election Day bias to the Republican part to bring their early vote targets to 2,601,566, the gap becomes 44%D-36%R. 

That's a 7 point swing, so I will keep the statement on the website that anything within 5% is good news.
